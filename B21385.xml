            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE <hi>JOHN</hi> Lord <hi>VAƲGHAN,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I CANNOT easily excuse the printing of a PLAY at so unseasonable a time, when the Great Plot of the Nation, like one of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine, has devour'd its younger Brethren of the Stage: But however weak my defence might be for this, I am sure I shou'd not need any to the World, for my Dedication to your Lordship; and if you can pardon my presumption in it, that a bad Poet should address himself to so great a Judge of Wit, I may hope at least to scape with the Excuse of <hi>Catul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> when he writ to <hi>Cicero:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Gratias tibi Maximas <hi>Catullus</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Agit, pessimus omnium Poeta;</l>
                  <l>Tanto pessimus omnium Poeta,</l>
                  <l>Quanto tu optimus omnium Patronus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I have seen an Epistle of <hi>Fleckno</hi>'s to a Noble-man, who was by some extraordinary chance a Scholar; (and you may please to take notice by the way, how natural the connection of thought is betwixt a bad Poet and <hi>Fleckno</hi>) where he begins thus: <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuordecim jam elapsi sunt anni, &amp;c.</hi> his <hi>Latin,</hi> it seems, not holding out to the end of the Sentence; but he endeavour'd to tell his Patron, betwixt two
<pb facs="tcp:199793:3"/>Languages which he understood alike, that it was 14 years since he had the happiness to know him; 'tis just so long, and as happy be the Omen of dulness to me, as it is to some Clergy-men and States-men, since your Lordship has known that there is a worse Poet remaining in the world than he of scandalous memory who left it last. I might inlarge upon the subject with my Author, and assure you, that I have serv'd as long for you, as one of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did for his Old Testament Mistress: But I leave those flourishes, when occasion shall serve, for a greater O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator to use, and dare only tell you, that I never pass'd any part of my life with greater satisfaction or improvement to my self, than those Years which I have liv'd in the honour of your Lordships Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If I may have only the time abated when the Publick Service call'd you to another part of the World, which in imitation of our Florid Speakers, I might, (if <hi>I</hi> durst-presume upon the expression) call the <hi>Parenthesis of my Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I have always honour'd you, I suppose I need not tell you at this time of day; for you know I staid not to date my respects to you from that Title which now you have, and to which you bring a greater addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by your Merit, than you receive from it by the Name; but I am proud to let others know how long it is that <hi>I</hi> have been made happy by my knowledge of you, because <hi>I</hi> am sure it will give me a Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the present Age, and with Posterity. And now, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> know you are afraid, lest <hi>I</hi> should take this occasion, which lies so fair for me, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb facs="tcp:199793:3"/>the World with some of those Excellencies which <hi>I</hi> have admir'd in you; but <hi>I</hi> have reasonably consider'd, that to acquaint the World, is a Phrase of a malicious meaning: for it would imply, that the World were not already acquainted with them. You are so generally known to be above the meanness of my praises, that you have spar'd my Evidence, and spoil'd my Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: should <hi>I</hi> take for my common places, your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both of the old and the new <hi>Philosophy,</hi> should <hi>I</hi> add to these your skill in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>History,</hi> and yet farther, your being conversant with all the Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Tongues, as well as with the <hi>Modern, I</hi> should tell nothing new to Mankind; for when <hi>I</hi> have once but nam'd you, the World will antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate all my Commendations, and go faster before me than <hi>I</hi> can follow. Be therefore secure, my Lord, that your own Fame has freed it self from the danger of a <hi>Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi> and only give me leave to tell you, that <hi>I</hi> value the Candour of your Nature, and that one Character of Friendliness, and if <hi>I</hi> may have leave to call it, kindness in you, before all those other whick make you consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Nation.</p>
            <p>Some few of our Nobility are learned, and therefore <hi>I</hi> will not conclude an absolute contradiction in the terms of Noble man and Scholar; but as the World goes now, 'tis very hard to predicate one upon the other; and 'tis yet more difficult to prove, that a Noble-man can be a Friend to Poetry: Were it not for two or three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in <hi>WHITE-HALL,</hi> and in the Town, the Poets of this Age would find so little incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb facs="tcp:199793:4"/>for their labours, and so few Understanders, that they might have leisure to turn Pamphleteers, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the number of those abominable Scriblers, who in this time of License abuse the Press, almost every day, with Nonsense, and railing against the Government.</p>
            <p>It remains, my Lord, that I should give you some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Comedy, which you have never seen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was written and acted in your absence, at your Government of <hi>Jamaica.</hi> 'Twas intended for an honest <hi>Satyre</hi> against our crying sin of <hi>Keeping;</hi> how it would have succeeded, I can but guess, for it was permitted to be acted only thrice. The Crime for which it suffer'd, was that which is objected against the <hi>Satyres</hi> of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and the <hi>Epigrams</hi> of <hi>Catullus,</hi> that it exprese'd too much of the Vice which it decry'd: Your Lordship knows what Answer was return'd by the Elder of those Poets, whom I last mention'd, to his Accusers.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Castum esse decet pium Poetam</l>
               <l>Ipsum. Versiculos nihil necesse est:</l>
               <l>Qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem</l>
               <l>Si sint molliculi &amp; parum pudici.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> dare not make that Apology for my self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have taken a becoming care, that those things which offended on the Stage, might be either alter'd, or omitted in the Press: For their Authority is, and shall be ever sacred to me, as much absent as present, and in all altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Fortune, who for those Reasons have stopp'd its farther appearance on the <hi>Theatre.</hi> And whatsoever hinderance it has been to me, in point of profit, many of my Friends can bear me witness, that <hi>I</hi> have not once murmur'd against that Decree. The same Fortune once
<pb facs="tcp:199793:4"/>happen'd to <hi>Moliere,</hi> on the occasion of his <hi>Tartuffe;</hi> which notwithstanding afterwards has seen the light, in a Country more <hi>Bigot</hi> than ours, and is accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the best Pieces of that Poet. <hi>I</hi> will be bold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to say, that this <hi>Comedy</hi> is of the first Rank of those which <hi>I</hi> have written, and that Posterity will be of my Opinion. It has nothing of particular <hi>Satyre</hi> in it: for whatsoever may have been pretended by some Criticks in the Town, <hi>I</hi> may safely and solemnly affirm, that no one Character has been drawn from any single man; and that <hi>I</hi> have known so many of the same humour, in every folly which is here expos'd, as may serve to warrant it from a particular Reflection. It was printed in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from the Town, this Summer, much against my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, otherwise <hi>I</hi> had over-look'd the Press, and been yet more careful, that neither my Friends should have had the least occasion of unkindness against me, nor my Enemies of upbraiding me; but if it live to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Impression, <hi>I</hi> will faithfully perform what has been wanting in this. In the mean time, my Lord, <hi>I</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to your Protection, and beg <hi>I</hi> may keep still that place in your favour which <hi>I</hi> have hitherto enjoy'd; and which <hi>I</hi> shall reckon as one of the greatest Blessings which can befall,</p>

                  <p>According to humane appearance, I must confess, 'tis neither fit for you, nor you for it; but, have patience, Sir, matters are not so bad as they may seem: there are pious Baudy-houses in the World, or Conventicles wou'd not be so much frequented: Neither is it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but a Devout Fanatick-Landlady of a Boarding-House may be a Baud.</p>

Your Father sent you into <hi>France</hi> at twelve year old, bred you up at <hi>Paris,</hi> first, in a College, and then at an <hi>Academy:</hi> At the first, instead of running through a course of Philosophy, you ran through all the Bandy-houses in Town: At the later, instead of managing the Great Horse, you exercis'd on your Master's Wife. What you did in <hi>Germany,</hi> I know not; but that you beat 'em all at their own Weapon, <hi>Drinking,</hi> and have brought home a Goblet of Plate from <hi>Munster,</hi> for the Prize of swallowing a Gallon of <hi>Rhenish</hi> more than the <hi>Bishop.</hi>

                  <p>All's well: he knows me not. Sir, your civility is obliging to a Stranger, and may befriend me, in the acquaintance of our fellow-Lodgers.</p>

                  <p>Hold you there, Sir: I must first understand you a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and yet, methinks, you shou'd be true to love.</p>

                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>Drinking, and Wenching, are but slips of Youth: I had those good qualities from my Father.</p>

                  <p>Why, what a <hi>Turk Mahomet</hi> shall I be! No, I will not make my self drunk, with the conceit of so much joy: the Fortunes too great for mortal man; and I a poor unworthy sinner.</p>

                  <p>Wou'd I lye to my Friend? Am I a Man? am I a Christian? there is that Wife you mention'd, a delicate little wheedling Devil, with such an appearance of simplicity; and with that, she does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, so fool her conceited Husband, that he despises her!</p>

                  <p>Peace, peace; thou art yet ordain'd for greater things. There's another too, a kept Mistress, a brave Strapping Jade, a two-handed Whore!</p>

                  <p>But this Lady is so Termagant an Empress! and he so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive, so tame, so led a Keeper, and as proud of his Slavery, as a <hi>French</hi> man: I am confident he dares not find her false, for fear of a quarrel with her; because he is sure to be at the charges of the War; She knows he cannot live without her, and therefore seeks occasions of falling out to make him purchase peace.

                  <p>Might not I ask you one civil question? How pass you your time in this Noble Family? for I find you are a Lover of the Game, and shou'd be loth to hunt in your Purliews.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Aldo.</speaker>
                  <p>I must first tell you something of my condition: I am here a Friend to all of 'em; I am their <hi>Fac totum,</hi> do all their business; for, not to boast, Sir, I am a man of general acquaintance: there's no News in Town, either Foreign or Domestick, but I have it first; no Mortgage of Lands, no sale of Houses, but I have a finger in 'em.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, I suppose, you are a gainer by your pains.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Aldo.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I do all <hi>gratis,</hi> and am most commonly a loser; only a Buck sometimes from this good Lord, or that good Lady in the Country: and I eat it not alone, I must have company.</p>

                  <speaker>Aldo.</speaker>
                  <p>Peace, peace, I am coming to you: Why, you must know I am tender-natur'd; and if any unhappy difference have arisen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Mistress and her Gallant, then I strike in to do good offices betwixt 'em; and, at my own proper charges, conclude the quarrel with a reconciling Supper.</p>

                  <speaker>Wood.</speaker>

                  <p>Before <hi>George,</hi> I love the poor little Devils. I am indeed a Father to 'em, and so they call me: I give 'em my Counsel, and assist 'em with my Purse. I cannot see a pretty Sinner hurri'd to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by the Land-Pyrats, but Nature works, and I must Bail her: or want a Supper, but I have a couple of cram'd Chickens, a Cream Tart, and a Bottle of Wine to offer her.</p>

                  <speaker>Aldo.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith, not much: Nature in me is at low water-mark; my Body's a Jade, and tires under me, yet I love to smuggle still in a Corner; pat 'em down, and pur over 'em; but, after that, I can do 'em little harm.</p>

                  <p>Then I'm acquainted with your business: you wou'd be a kind of Deputy-Fumbler under me.</p>

                     <p>Why shou'd my Mother be so inquisitive about this Lodger?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:199793:17"/>I half suspect Old <hi>Eve</hi> her self has a mind to be nibling at the Pippin: he makes Love to one of 'em, I am confident; it may be to both; for methinks I shou'd have done so, if I had been a Man; but the damn'd Petticoats have perverted me to honesty, and therefore I have a grudge to him, for the Priviledge of his Sex. He shuns me too, and that vexes me; for though I wou'd deny him, I scorn he shou'd not think me worth a civil question.</p>

                     <p>You have made me languish in expectation, Madam. VVas it nothing, do you think, to be so near a happiness, with violent desires, and to be delay'd?</p>

                     <p>Yes, I must ask thy advice in a most important business: I have promis'd a Charity to Mrs. <hi>Saintly,</hi> and she expects it with a beating heart a-bed: Now, I have at present no running Cash to throw away, my ready Money is all paid to Mrs. <hi>Tricksy,</hi> and the Bill is drawn upon me for to night.</p>

                  <p>WEll, you are a lucky man! Mrs. <hi>Brainsick</hi> is Fool e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to believe you wholly Innocent; and that the Adventure of the Garden-house last night, was only a Vision of Mrs. <hi>Saintly</hi>'s.</p>

                     <hi>Limberham</hi> must have found me out; that <hi>Fe-fa-fum</hi> of a Keeper wou'd have smelt the blood of a Cuckold-maker: they say, he was peeping and butting about in every cranny.</p>

                  <p>The truth is, she has past for her Daughter, by my appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but she has as good blood running in her veins, as the best of you: her Father, Mr. <hi>Palms,</hi> on his Death-bed, left her to my care and disposal; besides, a Fortune of twelve hundred a year; a pretty convenience, by my faith.</p>

                  <p>I have taken some care of her Education, and plac'd her here with Mrs. <hi>Saintly,</hi> as her Daughter, to avoid her being blown upon by Fops, and younger Brothers.
